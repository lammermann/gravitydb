The Gravity Database
--------------------

Just as gravity connects the universe it now connects data invisibly.

Gravity is a graph database trying to make the traversal as easy as possible
for complex data. There are several goals it tries to archive:

* provide an elegant way to traverse
* be scalable
* can be easily split, distributed, shared and merged
